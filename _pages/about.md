I am a 6th year math PhD student at the
[University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu){:target="_blank"}. I plan to graduate in the
Spring of 2022. My advisor is
[Thomas Mark](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/tom-mark){:target="_blank"}.

Before attending the University of Virginia, I graduated with a [Master's of
Science in the Physical Sciences Division](https://mspsd.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} at the
[University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"}, with a concentration
in mathematics.

I am interested in low-dimensional topology. More specifically, I use tools from
symplectic topology and gauge theory to study 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds.
Most recently, I have been working on using involutive Heegaard Floer
homology and lattice cohomology to obstruct certain 3-manifolds from being
obtained by zero surgery on a knot in the three sphere.
