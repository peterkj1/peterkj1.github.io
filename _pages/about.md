Currently, I am transitioning from academia to industry. From 2022 to 2024, I was a visiting assistant professor in the mathematics department at [Michigan State University](https://math.msu.edu){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I graduated from the mathematics PhD program at the
[University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu){:target="_blank"} in May of 2022 under the direction of [Thomas Mark](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/tom-mark){:target="_blank"}.

Before attending the University of Virginia, I graduated with a [Master's of
Science in the Physical Sciences Division](https://mspsd.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} at the
[University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"}, with a concentration
in mathematics.

My mathematical interests are in low-dimensional topology, in particular using Floer homology to study 3- and
4-dimensional manifolds. I am also interested in connections between lattice homology
and the $$\widehat{Z}$$ invariant.
