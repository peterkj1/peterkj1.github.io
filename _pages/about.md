Currently, I am a mathematics postdoc at [Michigan State University](https://math.msu.edu){:target="_blank"}.
I graduated from the mathematics PhD program at the
[University of Virginia](https://math.virginia.edu){:target="_blank"} in May of 2022 under the direction of [Thomas Mark](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/tom-mark){:target="_blank"}.

Before attending the University of Virginia, I graduated with a [Master's of
Science in the Physical Sciences Division](https://mspsd.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} at the
[University of Chicago](https://mathematics.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"}, with a concentration
in mathematics.

I am interested in low-dimensional topology. More specifically, I use tools from
symplectic topology and gauge theory to study 3 and 4 dimensional manifolds.
Most recently, I have been working on using involutive Heegaard Floer
homology and lattice cohomology to obstruct certain 3-manifolds from being
obtained by zero surgery on a knot in the three sphere. I have also been
exploring connections between lattice cohomology, Heegaard Floer homology, and
the $$\widehat{Z}$$ invariant.
